# todo-list
A typical todo list from scratch, full-stack with React, Redux, Thunk


## Build process
This is a step-by-step walkthrough of my thought process in building this web-app.

1. [ ] Starting with creating directories and loading dev dependencies
    - server: 
      - routes
      - db
    - client:
      - actions
      - reducers
      - components
      - containers
      - index.js
    - test
    - `yarn add` dependencies and devDependencies
    - config webpack
    - `.gitignore` node_modules and other files 
2.  [ ] Add knex migration tables with dummy seed data
3.  [ ] Basic database function and back end routes done for `getAllTodos`
4.  [ ] Front end routes, actions and reducers to render todos on Home page
5.  [ ] Deploy to Heroku
6.  [ ] Configure and write db and routes tests
7.  [ ] Impliment bulma for styling and remove
